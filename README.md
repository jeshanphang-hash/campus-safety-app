# ðŸ“± Campus Safety App (Prototype)

## ðŸŽ¯ Track 2: Campus Management

---

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
Campus safety is a growing concern for students, staff, and faculty, especially during late hours or in isolated campus areas.  
This project proposes a **Campus Safety Mobile Application** that provides a one-stop platform for emergencies, real-time alerts, and safety resources.

This repository contains the **prototype design** built using [Figma](https://decal-bliss-20129420.figma.site/).

---

## ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement
Current campus safety infrastructure lacks:

- Comprehensive **real-time response**
- Easy ways for students to **report and share emergencies**
- Centralized **safety resources** in one app

This app aims to fill these gaps by offering a mobile-first safety solution.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Features (Prototype Phase)
- **Home Page**  
  - SOS Emergency Button  
  - Campus Map (search & share location)  

- **Report Page**  
  - Report incidents with details/photos  
  - Track incident status updates  

- **First Aid**  
  - Quick step-by-step first aid guides  

- **Sensor / Campus Status Overview**  
  - Live campus-wide alerts (e.g., flood, haze, power outage)  

- **Settings**  
  - Manage personal information & emergency contacts  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Future Enhancements
- **AI Call** â†’ Pretend call simulation for safety (e.g., when walking alone)
  -> Tech Idea: AI voice generation (e.g., Google Cloud Text-to-Speech, OpenAI TTS) + scripted dialogues to simulate a real phone call.
- **Auto Call** â†’ Automatic robotic call to campus security with GPS location
  -> Tech Idea: Telephony API (e.g., Twilio, Vonage) to send automated voice calls/SMS with real-time GPS data from the app.

## ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

### ðŸŸ¢ Current Prototype (Built in Figma)
- **Design & Prototyping** â†’ Figma (UI/UX, clickable prototype)  
- **Hosting (Prototype)** â†’ Figma site link for presentation/demo  

---

### ðŸŸ¢ Planned Implementation (Feasible Build)
- **Frontend** â†’ React Native (cross-platform mobile app)  
- **Backend** â†’ Supabase (authentication, user database, incident reports storage)  
- **Maps** â†’ Google Maps API (location search, location sharing, GPS tracking)  
- **Push Notifications** â†’ Firebase Cloud Messaging (free)  

---

### ðŸŸ¢ Future Enhancements (AI Call & Auto Call)

**AI Call (Fake Conversation for Safety)**  
- Google Cloud Text-to-Speech â†’ free tier (4M characters/month for 12 months)  
- Alternative: OpenAI TTS or Coqui TTS (open-source, free, local)  

**Auto Call (Emergency Voice Call & SMS Alerts)**  
- Twilio â†’ free trial + pay-per-use (~$0.01/min for calls, ~$0.0075 per SMS)  
- Alternative: Vonage API (similar pricing)  
- Backup for notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging (free for push alerts)  


---

## ðŸ”¹ Impact
- Faster response in emergencies  
- Improved feeling of safety on campus  
- Helps authorities monitor and respond proactively
