# ðŸ“± Campus Safety App (Prototype)

## ðŸŽ¯ Track 2: Campus Management

---

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
Campus safety is a critical concern for students, staff, and faculty, especially during late hours or in isolated areas.  
This project proposes a **Campus Safety Mobile Application** â€” a one-stop platform for emergencies, real-time alerts, and safety resources.

This repository contains the **prototype design** built using [Figma](https://decal-bliss-20129420.figma.site/).

---

## ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement
Current campus safety systems face challenges such as:
- Limited **real-time response**
- Few options for students to **report or share emergencies quickly**
- Lack of **centralized safety resources** in one place

This app addresses these gaps with a mobile-first solution.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Features (Prototype Phase)
- **Home Page**: SOS emergency button, campus map (search & share location)  
- **Report Page**: Report incidents with details/photos, track status updates  
- **First Aid**: Quick step-by-step first aid guides  
- **Campus Status**: Live campus-wide alerts (e.g., flood, haze, power outage)  
- **Settings**: Manage personal info & emergency contacts  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Future Enhancements
- **AI Call** â€“ Pretend call simulation for safety (e.g., when walking alone)  
  - *Idea*: AI-generated voices + scripted dialogues to simulate real phone calls.  
- **Auto Call** â€“ Automated call to campus security with GPS location  
  - *Idea*: Telephony APIs (e.g., Twilio, Vonage) to send voice calls/SMS alerts.
